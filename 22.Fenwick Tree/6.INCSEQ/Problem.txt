Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) integers S1, ..., SN (0 ≤ Si < 100,000), compute the number of increasing subsequences of S with length K (1 ≤ K ≤ 50 and K ≤ N); that is, the number of K-tuples i1, ..., iK such that 1 ≤ i1 < ... < iK ≤ N and Si1 < ... < SiK.
Input
The first line contains the two integers N and K. The following N lines contain the integers of the sequence in order.
Output
Print a single integer representing the number of increasing subsequences of S of length K, modulo 5,000,000.
